   * NOTE: What's with all this?
   *
   * When using `load`, SvelteKit has a technique called _hydration_ to send data
   * fetched during SSR to the browser.
   * See: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/appendix#hydration
   *
   * It is fairly easy for this technique to fail, which typically results in duplicated requests
   * to the API server. SvelteKit can't warn us about it yet.
   * See also: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3729
   *
   * One key thing for hydration to work is that the `data-url` of the special
   * HTML tag included in the SSR HTML should match the URL of a request the browser
   * might do once it loads the app.
   *
   * As per our API-client wiring strategy (see `getApiUrl()` above), this is _generally_ the case.
   * But in some situations these URLs may be different (1), e.g. because in live environments
   * SSR and browser API calls are made to different locations.
   *
   * So right now we need this patch (2) to ensure `data-url` values match in that case too.
   *
   * See: https://github.com/etalab/catalogage-donnees/issues/71
